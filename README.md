# Maintained Fork

This repository is an actively maintained fork of the original **Alarm.com for Home Assistant** integration.

The goal of this fork is to maintain compatibility with modern Home Assistant releases while continuing development of the Alarm.com integration as the Home Assistant platform evolves.

Recent Home Assistant updates introduced architectural changes that affect older integrations. This fork adapts the integration to those changes and ensures continued functionality, including compliance with the Home Assistant device registry enforcement requirements introduced in Home Assistant 2025.12.

Community feedback, testing, and contributions are welcome.

# Overview

This custom integration allows Home Assistant to interface with [**Alarm.com**](https://Alarm.com) using the Alarm.com web platform.

The integration focuses primarily on Alarm.com security system functionality and requires an Alarm.com service package that includes security system support.

Because this integration communicates with Alarm.com cloud services, functionality may change if Alarm.com modifies their platform.

> [!WARNING]
> # Safety Notice
>
>This integration is designed for **convenience and automation**, but it should **not be relied upon for safety-critical functions.**
>
>Reasons include:
>
>1. This integration communicates with Alarm.com using unofficial endpoints.
>2. Alarm.com status updates may take time to propagate.
>3. Home Assistant automations may introduce unintended behavior.
>4. This code is community developed and may contain bugs.
>
>For critical alerts such as:
>
>* Break-ins
>* Fire
>* Carbon monoxide
>* Water leaks
>* Freeze warnings
>
>You should rely on **Alarm.com's official monitoring services and mobile applications.**
>
>Where possible, use **locally controlled Home Assistant integrations** for automation. Local integrations continue functioning during internet outages, while >this integration requires cloud communication.

> [!TIP]
> Some alarm.com devices use Z-Wave, so if you have a Z-Wave dongle then you can move the devices from alarm.com to Home Assistant's [native Z-Wave integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zwave_js/)

However, newer Security+ 3.0 garage doors do not work with a RATGDO or anything similar to it so this may be the only way to control it using Home Assistant.  |

# Data Updates

This integration's IoT class is cloud push, so when a change happens on alarm.com home assistant is notified about it. As a backup this integration also polls alarm.com for state changes every 5 minutes.

Because this integration is cloud push, that means every actions goes through alarm.com's cloud and an active internet connection is required for this integration to work.

---
# Camera Support

This integration includes WebRTC live-streaming support for Alarm.com cameras.

## Setup

1. Copy `www/alarm-webrtc-card.js` from this repository to your Home Assistant `www/` folder.
2. Add it as a Lovelace resource:
   - Go to **Settings → Dashboards → Resources**
   - Click **Add Resource**
   - URL: `/local/alarm-webrtc-card.js`
   - Type: **JavaScript module**
3. Add the card to any Lovelace dashboard:

```yaml
type: custom:alarm-webrtc-card
entity: camera.your_camera_name
```

## How it works

When the card loads it calls the `camera.turn_on` service which fetches a fresh set of WebRTC tokens from Alarm.com. Tokens are refreshed automatically every 30 minutes in the background so the stream is always ready. If a token expires before the next scheduled refresh the card requests new tokens automatically.

Still image snapshots are also available, which means the camera will display a thumbnail in the Home Assistant media browser and picture-glance dashboard cards.


## Removing This Integration

Removing this integration is the same as most HACS integrations:

- Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** and select the alarm.com integration card.
- From the list of devices, select the alarm.com entry.
- Next to the entry, select the three-dot menu, then select **Delete**.
- Repeat steps 2 and 3 for every entry you have
- Go to HACS, select the three-dot menu for this integration, then select **Remove**.
- Then restart Home Assistant to clear the cache
